### Closing the dialog and reseting the form inside it

Whenever we try to close a dialog using any of the ways available whether it be through user interaction like clicking outside the dialog or the Esc key or through the button that the dev intended, a close event is triggered. We can simply use that even to add a line in js to reset the form using `form.reset()` method.
